        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>
            This website is a collaborative work with <a href="https://github.com/Kanjirito">Kanjirito</a>, who has downloaded and parsed the JSON data on Warframe Rivens, with a lot of calculation done. Do check <a href="https://github.com/Kanjirito/rivens-json-browse-back-end">his GitHub repository</a> to see how its done.
        </p>

        <p>
            The parsed JSON data is presented in a nice, tabular format here, for easier filtering and searching. You can find out more about the JSON data in the <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1077490-riven-trading-toolbuilders-phase-1/"> forum announcement</a>.

                                        This is a derived value, based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b88r1l/i_updated_the_riven_trade_data_spreadsheet_with/ejwmb6s/"> comment from /u/ghoust4</a> on how to estimate the amount of Rivens sold.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It makes an assumption that a Riven with the same min, max, and average, with standard deviation of zero, <b>should</b> only have one Riven sold.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        From there, a ratio can be calculated based on the popularity, and the formula is applied across all the other Rivens.

                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/Kanjirito">Kanjirito</a> has made calculations on his script, which accumulates values up to one week before the specified week, and then a difference with the specified week is calculated. As an example:
                </p>
                <p class="text-monospace">
                    // let's say, we are looking at the median for bronco riven, in week 3
                    week 1 median: 102 <br>
                    week 2 median: 209 <br>
                    week 3 median: 104 <br>
                    average of median across week 1-2: (102 + 209) / 2 = 155.5 <br>
                    median diff: 104 - 155.5 = -51.5
                </p>
                <p class="text-monospace">
                    // or another, with the max for arca plasmor riven, in week 5
                    week 1 max: 102 <br>
                    week 2 max: 209 <br>
                    week 3 max: 82 <br>
                    week 4 max: 91 <br>
                    week 5 max: 672 <br>
                    average of max across week 1-4: (102 + 209 + 82 + 91) / 4 = 121 <br>
                    max diff: 672 - 121 = 551
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this differences, you can see the fluctuations of prices as the weeks go by.

                <p>
                    We are missing some of the earlier Rivens data for some platforms, and the classic version I built does not make any archive of the data. If you have a copy of the data, do let <a href="https://github.com/Kanjirito">Kanjirito</a> know!

                    Otherwise, it is possible for the data to be ready, but not processed yet. Please be patient.
